## Hi there 

HealthyPeruvians is a vibrant Discord community created by Peruvian students from UPC, dedicated to fostering a positive 
atmosphere where gamers can come together to enjoy video games and build lasting friendships. Whether 
you're into casual gaming or competitive play, this is a space where everyone is welcome. Our goal is to 
create a fun and supportive environment where members can share their love for gaming, connect with fellow 
students, and unwind after a long day of studies. Join us for game nights, tournaments, and great conversations!
